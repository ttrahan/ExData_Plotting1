## Overview

The files in this repository consist of the following:
  * README file describing the assignment (README.md)
  * This README file describing the code and output (README - 2.md)
  * One R script for downloading and reading the relevant source data.  This is
    referenced by the other scripts and does not need to be executed independently.
	(loadCourseProject1data.R)
  * Four R scripts for generating the required plots, as described in README.md
    (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R)
  * Four .png files displaying the output of the four R scripts
    (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png)
  
To generate any of the plot .png files, perform the following:
  * Set your working directory
  * Copy the five R scripts into your working directory
  * Execute any of the four "plot" R scripts, e.g. plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.
